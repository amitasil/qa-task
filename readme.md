# QA code task (technical role)

The application consists of two projects - UI (React SPA) and API (ASP.Net Core).

## What we have
A boilerplate code for both frontend and backend has been provided.

### UI:

The application has 4 pages and each page has instructions on what should be implemented:
- home page
- factorial - a user should be able to calculate *n!*
- fibonacci - a user should be able to calculate *Fib(n)*
- random square - a user should be able to calculate *rand(0, n)^2*

### API:

REST endpoints that are used in the UI have been implemented.


## What you need to do

### UI:
- Implement missing features
    > Please start the application (see instructions below) and explore it to understand what needs to be implemented.
- Implement the test suite to cover the UI. Preferred frameworks are `Jest` and `Cypress` but open to use any frameworks.

### API:

- Make sure the application logic is working correctly and feel free to refractor or change the code to make it work as desired.
- Implement the test suite to cover the API. Preferred framework is `NUnit`.

## This code task is to test a candidate's ability to (non exhaustive list):
- code
- write automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end as required)
- use git
- decide on testing strategy
- pay attention to details
- own and improve the code as required


## Before start

- Install dotnet SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- Install Yarn package manager: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

- NB: Current app has been tested with:
    - node: v10.16.0
    - yarn: 1.22.4
    - dotnet: 3.1.202
    - npm: 6.9.0

## Start

- `yarn start` - this will start ui (port 3000) and api  (port 3001)


## How to submit

Clone the repo and make the changes. Push the changes to your github and share the link to the repository with us. Make sure the the repository is publicly accessible.

Note: Please do not fork the repository or submit a pull request to this project.

## Corrections:
# "return x;" instead of "return n;" in FactorialCalculator.cs to correct the factorial value.

# corrected the spelling of pageId (fibinacci) in PageContentProvider.cs to correct the error coming on the Fibonacci page while page load

##Tests
# Used CodeceptJS to write the tests

#To run all the tests, use commend:
`npx codeceptjs run --steps`

#To run specific test (for e.g. Factorial), use command: 
'npx codeceptjs run --grep "Factorial"'
